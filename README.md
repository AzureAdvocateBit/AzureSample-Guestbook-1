# Data Driven Guestbook

[Guestbooks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guestbook) are a way for visitors to a event or location to leave their mark, typically with their name and message. Around the late 1990s/early 2000s, digital guestbooks were pretty popular.

This demo is a digital guestbook, that walks through different types of data, using the Azure Data platform.

## How it works

This demo is single page application (SPA), written in JavaScript that reads from MySQL and Cosmos DB databases.

- Grabs all entries from both databases, displays its source, and sorts them by date
- Adds new entries to database of choice
- Updates page with new entries using Web Sockets
